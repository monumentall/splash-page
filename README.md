# splash-page

A splash page for Monumentall. 

The purpose of this README is to document progress on the splash page, provide a single source of truth for the purpose of the splash page, and keep track of how to update/modify/run the page for contributors.

The splash page will serve different purposes throughout different stages in the project life cycle. Pre-release, the splash page is meant to provide information about the project and also (potentially) allow interested parties to engage in some way with the app. More about this below. Post-release, the splash page may link to the app in the app store, provide more information about the app and development team, detail upcoming updates or releases, and aggregate reviews.

## While under development
MVP:
- [ ] An individual who is interested in the app and wants to learn more can easily locate this splash page

Nice to haves:

## After release
_To be determined_
